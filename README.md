This program generates a map on which there are several layers with different markers. There are such layers: the
layer indicates the films to be set in a year chosen by the user, the layer that paints the map according to the
population level of the countries, a layer which shows locations where the concerts of the group Ocean Elzy will take
place in 2018, a layer that shows the ice cover in Antarctica.
